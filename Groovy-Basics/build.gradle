/*
Gradle build scripts are written in Groovy. Groovy is a language that runs on
the JVM that fills a hole for Java developers who need a scripting language.
It's terse, expressive, interoperates extremely well with Java, and has some
special features that make it ideally suited for creating domain specific
languages.

in this file i am going to write some simple groovy codes

We'll just declare a task called `groovy` that doesn't do anything. To run
this script, just ask Gradle to run the `groovy` task using

    $ gradle groovy
*/

task groovy << {}

println "Hello World"
